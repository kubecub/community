# CONTIRIBUTING

We expect as many developers as possible to contribute, which is the motivation for our efforts to maintain the community

Read the [contributor documentation](../CONTRIBUTING.md), which will teach you how to contribute to the open source community in a standardized way, be it code, documentation, or even how to raise an issue and discuss it in the community


## Join community meetings for discussion
Keep a record of every discussion in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/kubecub/discussions), and our minutes are written in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nx8MDpuG74NASx081JcCpxPgDITNTpIIos0DS6Vr9GU/edit?usp=sharing).
