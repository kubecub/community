Welcome to the community ðŸŽ‰</b><br><br>Don''t forget after accepting to make it public so it appears on your GitHub profile for everyone else to see. You can do this by finding your name in the GitHub organisation list and change the dropdown to public https://github.com/orgs/kubecub/people<br><br>Tips for practising:<br><br>When you accept the invitation after will find that the introduction of http://github.com/kubecub has refresh, you can participate in the development of kubecub any modules or even a new module.<br>Remember contributing to open source is not just about code, it''s about collaboration, communication and adding value<br>I hope that helps'
