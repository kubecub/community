Welcome to the OpenIMSDK Community repository! This repository is for anyone who is interested in contributing to the development and growth of OpenIMSDK.

OpenIMSDK is an open-source instant messaging software development toolkit. It can help developers quickly build application programs based on instant messaging functions. The toolkit provides rich API interfaces, supporting the sending and receiving of various message types, including text messages, voice messages, image messages, etc. In addition, it also provides group chat, chat room, friend management, etc., which greatly facilitates the development work of developers.

For developers, OpenIMSDK is an easy-to-use, efficient, and stable toolkit, which can greatly reduce development cycle and cost, improve the interaction experience and user satisfaction of application programs.
